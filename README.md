# DC Asphalt Plant Analysis

This repo contains code used for a geospatial analysis, interactive visualization and graphs behind the article published at https://ggwash.org/view/92933/permit-renewal-for-eckington-asphalt-plant-raises-questions-about-air-quality-health on Mar 14, 2024.

Its specific contents will probably not be of *too* much interest to anyone who isn't working to replicate the analysis. But it does provide some okay patterns for related development.

My use of vite + typescript + tailwind + mapbox in `web/` is not going to set the world on fire, but it was a nice chance to update my web skills a bit (my design skills remain regrettable).

It's harder to find good examples for PostGIS development using bash, so the contents of `sql/` might be compelling (even if they are not as organized as they probably could be).

`jupyter/` is an oddball, present only to allow me to fiddle with one plotly graph that went through many revisions before becoming something sensible.
